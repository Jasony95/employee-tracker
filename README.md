# Employee Tracker

## Description

The project is to create a database that will contain information regarding to the department, role, and employee of a company.

- The motivation is to create a project that will imitate a database that will have data of a typical company.
- I build this project because I want to know how a MySQL database functions and how it is used in a typical scenario database.
- It solves the problem of organizing a company's database.
- I learned that a database is necessary in a company.
